    <h1 id="Physics">Physics</h1>
    <p>Physics is the branch of science that deals with the structure of matter and how the fundamental constituents of
        the universe interact. It studies objects ranging from the very small using quantum mechanics to the entire
        universe using general relativity.But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual
        observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two
        weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for
        the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. And
        so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other,
        there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by
        no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other</p>

    <p>Algebra is the art of manipulating equations and formulas. Diophantus (3rd century) and al-Khwarizmi (9th
        century) were the two main precursors of algebra.[38][39] Diophantus solved some equations involving unknown
        natural numbers by deducing new relations until he obtained the solution. Al-Khwarizmi introduced systematic
        methods for transforming equations, such as moving a term from one side of an equation into the other side. The
        term algebra is derived from the Arabic word al-jabr meaning 'the reunion of broken parts'[40] that he used for
        naming one of these methods in the title of his main treatise.

        Algebra became an area in its own right only with François Viète , who introduced the use of
        variables for representing unknown or unspecified numbers.[41] Variables allow mathematicians to describe the
        operations that have to be done on the numbers represented using mathematical formulas.</p>

    <p>English is a language that started in Anglo-Saxon England. It is originally from Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon
        dialects. English is now used as a global language. There are about 375 million native speakers (people who use
        it as their first language) in the world.[3]

        Scots is the language closest to English. The vocabulary of English was influenced by other Germanic languages
        in the early Middle Ages and later by Romance languages, especially French.

        English is the only official language or one of the official languages of nearly 60 countries. It is also the
        main language of more countries in the world than any other. It is the primary language in the United Kingdom,
        the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland. It is one of the official
        languages in Singapore, India, Hong Kong, and South Africa. It is widely spoken in parts of the Caribbean,
        Africa, and South Asia.</p>

    <h1 id="DataStructures">DataStructures</h1>
    <p>Since the invention of computers, people have been using the term "Data" to refer to Computer Information, either
        transmitted or stored. However, there is data that exists in order types as well. Data can be numbers or texts
        written on a piece of paper, in the form of bits and bytes stored inside the memory of electronic devices, or
        facts stored within a person's mind. As the world started modernizing, this data became a significant aspect of
        everyone's day-to-day life, and various implementations allowed them to store it differently.

        Data is a collection of facts and figures or a set of values or values of a specific format that refers to a
        single set of item values. The data items are then classified into sub-items, which is the group of items that
        are not known as the simple primary form of the item.

        Let us consider an example where an employee name can be broken down into three sub-items: First, Middle, and
        Last. However, an ID assigned to an employee will generally be considered a single item.

    <h1 id="Chemistry">Chemistry</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.[1] It is a physical science within
        the natural sciences that studies the chemical elements that make up matter and compounds made of atoms,
        molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during
        reactions with other substances.[2][3][4][5] Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical
        compounds.

        In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.[6] It is
        sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied
        scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[7] For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth
        (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental
        pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work
        (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).</p>
