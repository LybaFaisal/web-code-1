        Zaib Taj d/o Tufail Ahmed Jumani (Rtd. Secretary Gov. Sindh) started her journey as beneficiary (user) of
        HANDS-DWA Independent Living Center from 15-April-2019. She was depressed & isolated in her home for 7 years
        because of her disability and lost her self-confidence completely She became disabled by a gunshot from police
        mobile which damaged her spinal cord and left her paralyzed. A qualified doctor moving independently suddenly
        became a totally dependent person which was a big shock along with the shock of getting divorced just after her
        marriage.

        After 7 years of isolation and despair one of the colleague of Mr. Tufail Jumani met Zaib and observed her
        condition and referred her to “HANDS-DWA ILC” where she was treated as guest of honor. Dr. Zaib Taj visited the
        ILC she was shocked to see that a large number activist were serving humanity on a wheelchairs and have learned
        to live with their disabilities and making themselves useful for humanity. She received “Peer Counseling” by a
        Spinal Cord Peer counselor with the same disability and within few days Dr. Zaib started coming back to life.
        She started to teach the children with disabilities of HANDS-DWA ILC which helped to get her back in her
        professional life. Team HANDS-DWA ILC nominated her for the skill training for which she went to Islamabad and
        exhibited self- confidence as she did air travel with the support of personal attendant. She is now part of
        HANDS- DWA – ILC team as full time doctor.

        Please read in her own words .
        “ Hello All Doctors ( esp females )
        It’s been long time I wanted to share story of my postgraduate medical journey with all of you but due to busy
        professional and family life I couldn’t write it earlier ,
        Today I would like to take this opportunity to share my post graduate medical journey with all of you especially
        females .
        I am graduate of Baqai Medical University
        My journey is a journey of every middle class female who dreams to do some thing big and extraordinary in their
        life, to turn my dream into reality I followed these simple rules and suggest you do to the same .
        1) Must not waste time during your undergraduate , you must study very very hard so that you can save time
        afterwards because as soon as you graduate your clock will start, there will be immense pressure on you from all
        side especially from parents to get marry and start life , so long you are in medical college you have a
        protected shield , every one is happy to support you for studies. So utilise this time as best you can, read
        from text books , reference books, avoid review books as much you can , Study almost every day 4/5 hours no
        matter what.
        2) Soon after graduation start your house job, don’t delay it at all unless you are getting married or there is
        strong reason not to do , always do house job in medicine and surgery 6-6 months as thats GMC acceptable
        pattern. House job should not stop you from studying , make sure what ever patients you see you study well on it
        plus continue with your home study routine as you were doing in medical school.
        3) FCPS 1, try to do FCPS1 as a back up plan which I did it one month after my house job, here your previous
        hard work will count , if you have studied well before than FCPS 1 can be done with 2-3 months prep.( remember
        this was not my goal this was my back up plan)
        4) Don’t delay your marriages , my FcPS 1 result was announced on day of my engagement , so never ever turn down
        suitable proposals, trust me your degrees and trainings will eventually be done if you are determinant , career
        breaks are very common here in west so don’t worry about it.
        Make 10 years plan
        5 years for family and kids and 5 years for post graduate training and exams , grab what comes first don’t turn
        down any blessing of Allah.
        5) After marriage we had to do a lot of struggle,
        me and my Husband Dr Ash both were FCPS post graduate trainee at DUHS, our salary was 6200 PKr which we didn’t
        used to get for 3-6 months , we used to Travel by Bus ( W-11) and P3 ,
        To fulfil our dreams we started teaching medical students at home , which made our life little easier.
        After 36 hours post call we both used to teach medical students at our home and than In night we used to do our
        own study .
        6) During our post graduate residency training we used to study for USMLE and teach medical students, despite of
        such a hard work we couldn’t save enough to pay for USMLE for both of us, here my husband uncle stepped in Abdul
        Rasheed Sorathia he gave us full freedom , he said “book whatever exam you wish to book, book all in one go...
        do what you like I will pay fee for both of you ..... “
        Here comes the turning point in our life....
        now we were not worried about finances ..
        we just had to study ... study and Study..
        7) USMLEs
        Uncle Rasheed ( My father in law) booked USMLES 1-2 Ck CSA for both us ...
        And we both did step 1 in three months step 2 in 3 months , with score 98/99 we did this with our full time post
        graduate training at DUHS .
        8 ) Ielts PLAB 1-2.
        BecAuse of uSA complicated visa issues we decided to do PLAB. We joined AEO Australian IELTS preps Center in
        Clifton, on pre call day we both used to go to AEO on bike ( 1979 bike) I still love bikes , what a memory.
        9) We both passed IELTS than what... plab 1 was just a piece of cake for us , because of vast Usmle and FcPs
        1knowledge we didn’t had to study anything for PLaB1 , we just walked through PLaB 1 than didn plab 2 , during
        this time I traveled to USA for Usmle step 2 CS which I passed , did attachment in USA,
        Note : During my USMLE step 3 exam I was 8month pregnant .
        Here I completed MY GMC and USMLE ( year 2009 )
        Because my husband got nice job in Uk I preferred UK over USA
        I got job in same hospital where my husband worked , we both worked at Same hospital in Wales , ( Nevil Hall
        hospital) , same hospital in Southend Same job title same departement , St Thomas Hospital London Same hospital
        same departement .
        So please try to take as many people you can on your side , don’t fight , dont argue, don’t do political or
        religious debates , may be your barelvi brother in law can do pick and drop for you 🙂 if you don’t upset him or
        your deobandi father in law pray day and night for you ... your pmln cousin May print out notes for you , PTI
        cousin may arrange airport pick ups and ppp uncle arrange accommodation for you in USA 🙂
        Out of 6 billion people on earth you have only 10-20 friends and family members around you who can do something
        for you so love and respect every one for sure you will need their help .
        If your target is big than you must avoid small talks .
        Thanks ,
        Hope it will help many.
        Remember in your prayers
        Dr Naila Ashfaque

        Dr Nimra from Indus Hospital credits her older sister for this career path as she had gotten into a medical
        school a few years ahead. Dr Nimra was inspired to follow the path paved by her sister, and for that reason, she
        managed to enroll in her dream college.
        Karachi-based general surgeon, Dr Shahzadi had a different form of motivation, but for a very good and sound
        reason. Her parents believed that respectable jobs suited for women were either teaching or in the medicine
        field. She took their advice, but slightly deviated from their original expectation; she chose to be a surgeon.
        Despite disagreeing on Dr Shahzadi's choice, a profession that was mostly male-dominated, her parents eventually
        respected their daughter's decision.

        Mehwish, a pharmacist in Islamabad, was the brightest among her siblings. That privilege granted her the freedom
        to explore her career options. Initially, she wanted to become a teacher but due to her love for biology
        classes, it boiled down to either pursuing physiotherapy or the medicine-surgery field. As soon as she was ready
        to opt for the latter, with her father's full support, fate took a different turn as Mehwish ended up completing
        her studies in pharmacology.

        <img src="c:\Users\Mg\Downloads\portrait-female-health-worker.jpg" alt="dr" border="3px" height="400px" width="350px">
        Meanwhile, Dr Ghina managed to overcome a classic form of a professional obstacle: gender bias in the workplace.
        She was driven to challenge the status quo by proving that she could handle extensive working hours, standing by
        to be on call while managing the role of a wife, a daughter and a mother simultaneously. She believed that
        balancing professional and personal life was key to succeeding at this position and that this 'journey of
        becoming a surgeon has been very rewarding'.
        Dividing her role as a pharmacist and as a trainer of the ICRC Emergency Room Trauma Course in Pakistan, Mehwish
        wishes to make a real difference in the medical field and let the world acknowledge that women pharmacists
        deserve more respect.

        Speaking of respect, Mehwish was sparked with joy at one time when a house staff thanked her for alleviating her
        pain with a drug prescription that helped her significantly. "She called me the best doctor in the world," said
        Mehwish.

        What led to your interest in medicine?
        When I was younger my neighbor got into a car accident down the street from my house, and I remember watching
        the Life Flight helicopter land and take-off-- that sparked my initial interest in paramedicine. (Paramedicine
        is a term describing various individuals who have emergency medical service training and credentials.) Later, as
        a young adult, I dealt with family illnesses that caused me to spend a lot of time in the hospital, and I became
        very curious about everything that took place there. It was the culmination of these experiences that led me to
        become increasingly interested in the field of medicine.

        What experiences did you have that confirmed medicine was the right career for you?
        Initially I wanted to pursue a career in law enforcement, but there were certain experiences in my life that
        pushed me in the direction of medicine. I think the first, and perhaps the one that had the biggest impact, was
        losing my dad at age 13. I remember seeing the ICU and all the machines while visiting him-- this experience
        really changed the way I thought about medicine.

        Next, was experiencing my mom being diagnosed with cancer. Watching someone I loved dearly get sicker and sicker
        and eventually pass away confirmed my desire and passion to take care of others facing similar illnesses.
        Lastly, I had the opportunity to shadow in pediatric cardiac surgery and saw a pediatric cardiac
        transplantation, and that moment further solidified that I had to be involved in medicine. Seeing how medicine
        can have a drastic impact on someone’s life really made me commit down that path

        Shira Lanyi performed as a professional ballet dancer for a decade before earning her bachelor’s degree in
        biology. Her experiences shadowing the ballet company’s physician, as well as her mother’s cancer diagnosis,
        inspired her pivot to a medical career.
        I had one particularly debilitating injury early in my ballet career and had to take time off from dancing to
        allow my injury to heal, which was a huge struggle for me emotionally and physically. The ballet physician at
        the time invited me to shadow with him since I had expressed my interest in medicine on several occasions during
        our interactions. I felt that my background in dance and the athleticism inherent in the artform would give me a
        unique perspective, and I considered becoming a physician for a ballet company myself. It felt like the perfect
        balance of my two interests, and a harmonious transition from one career to the next.
        By doing my absolute best in my undergraduate studies, I felt I was the most prepared I could be for the medical
        school application process. VCU provided premedicine advisors who assisted in determining which courses were
        vital to take and when, as well as how to expand my resume outside of the classroom setting with volunteering
        and research. I began regularly volunteering with an organization that focused on adaptive sports for
        individuals in need. Research was harder for me to find and was something I constantly struggled to incorporate
        into my pre-medical school career.
